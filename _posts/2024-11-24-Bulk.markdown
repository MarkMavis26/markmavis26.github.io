## End of Week 1 11/20/24
I started officially Wednesday, November 13th. It is now Wednesday night on the 20th. In the beginning, I wrote a personal manifesto to lay out my reasons for starting and my plans for the project. The long and short of it was summarized in the intro above. With the help of my dad, I assembled the parts of a LEGO Mindstorms kit we had from several years before. After that, we got started on setting up my GitHub repository and this blog. To do so, Jekyll had to be installed. I've got to be honest, I knew Jekyll from Jekyll and Mr. Hyde before this project. Now I can say I have tapped the surface of the deep lake that Jekyll is. Along with that I of course used the terminal, that odd application with the daunting black screen and forbidding empty line block. Git is a not-so-self-explanatory application. It will take me awhile to get the hang of that, but thankfully I have the time. On the more tangible side, we got our first program running on the robot. With a sensor held up to my bright green shirt, the dutiful thing knew to move forward. It has been a week primarily made of setup, but I am not discouraged or quitting. That is more than can be said for a younger me. 

#### Big takeaways (from memory):
-Jekyll is a framework that uses ruby to convert markdown to html. Markdown is what I am using now as I type this. It is basically english from my current viewpoint

-Git is source control application. Source control is the process of creating repositories and tracking change to code. Through Git I was able to connect VS Code to my repository. And, I no longer have to enter my username/password when making changes. How convienent

-Learning is a process. Impatience has been a problem with my method of learning in the past. When I was young, if something didn't come to me quickly, I was much more likely to give up or assume I couldn't do it. I have grown in that way, as I am more patient (scratch that--more aware of my impatience) and can acurately assess things easier.

#### Quote of the Week
I may not do this every week, but I feel like it this time. My dad keeps saying "the obstacle is the way." I thought about this, noted its elegance, and soon forgot it. The next day, however, I was struggling in my chemistry class. I was frustrated because I had misunderstood a concept in class and didn't know why. I decided to go home and throughly review my notes. I was able to make a connection which deeped my understanding of the concept and solved my problem, and in that moment the quote came back to me. Mistakes and obstacles are remembered much easier than the times we figure things out without a problem. When we have them, we also remember the process to solve them and what the solution was. Obstacles make us better learners. Very cool quote brought up by Dad.

## End of Week 2 11/29/24
With setup mostly done, this week was about figuring out what this project will really entail. We decided to brainstorm ideas, getting them written down on a google document. I'll spare you the desheveled mess of information bound to spawn from Dad and I co-editing a doc. But there was talk of catapults and "hydroponic control systems" (we've tried this one before) and the like. We also just had a chance to discuss possibilities out loud. He told me that apparently the mass production of e-books by google was primarily preformed by page-turning robots at incredible speeds. I never considered that physical pictures had to actually be taken.

Later in the week I set off on doing some site cleanup (added an icon for the browser tab) and rearching the intricacies of the Lego Ev3 motors. A fascinating article I read ([Link Here](https://sites.google.com/site/ev3devpython/learn-ev3-python/using-motors)) got into the various features and uses of the motors included in the kit. This research allowed for an intuative understanding of how the color sensors work. We still are using EV3dev1 (most online examples are written for EV3dev2) so there are certain features currently inaccessible to us, but using ChatGPT (what a tool) I converted EV3dev2 into code usable for EV3dev1. I then got a line-following app running. Defining a desired light intensity and using the colorsensor for actual light intensity, an error variable finds the difference of the two. That difference is then multiplied by a proportional gain value for the "turn_rate." The "turn_rate" is added to the base speed of the left motor and subtracted from the base speed of the right. This obviously doesn't work if the line followed oscilates (or goes left). But it is a work in progress, and an exciting challenge. Next, we will figure a way to get that working with the one lightsensor. And buy some electrical tape. The offbrand expo marker wasn't cutting it for the line.

#### Big takeaways:
-ChatGPT is an incredible tool. While it is not always right, it is money when starting out on a project. When used and not abused, it revolutionizes modern learning.

-Git gets easier. That sounded funny, but in reality it isn't just git. Everything gets easier with consistency. It doesn't take long to get the hang of these things. A very refreshing prospect.
