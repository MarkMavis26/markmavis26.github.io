## End of Week 36-37 08/03/25
It has been awhile, I know, but I feel the break was necessary. And yes, I did take a break. Over the last two weeks, I have done very little with the project. I had a couple of overnight things with my XC team and felt this was a good period of time to do something like that. You see, I was on the verge of major burnout. As you could probably tell from my "weekly thoughts" over the last few weeks, I had been in a low place. The hard year was still taking its toll because I had not given myself a chance to recover. I busted my ass for the ACT and SAT and refused to relent in terms of the project. In theory that's all well and good, but I was going to cook myself up. This break has been refreshing and I have felt like I am on summer break for the first time all season. I am in a better place now and will try to pick up the pace again. I have been making progress with my uncle's battery project and I encourage you to read about it in the battery section of the "projects" tab.

School starts soon, and it will be my senior year. It is bitter sweet, but all in all, I am ready to move on to bigger and better things. Anyway, that is all for this week. Thank you to my diligent readers (my uncle and dad).
