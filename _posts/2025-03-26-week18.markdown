## End of Week 18 03/26/25
My blog is much later than usual this week and I'm chalking it up to my other obligations. I had to study for the ACT, which I took today. Finally, with that treacherous experience behind me, I can back into the swing of things. By the end of this week, I am hoping to have a video presentation prepared which displays the game I have been working on in Unity. It is not finished, probably never will be, but there has been progress significant to show off. 

Soon, I want to start working with my dad again. I have been on Unity for over two months now and am ready for something new. I am not sick of Unity by any means, it is fun and interesting to use, but each new step takes a lot of time. I want to work strictly with hardware next. It is time to dive into what will become a key aspect of my future major. Computer circuits and chips, sautering, and robotics will of course become imperative to learn. 

There is not much else to report from last week. These lulls in progress are inevitable, and will subside when I have more time during the summer.
