## My First Unity Game
Over the course of 6 months, I have been learning how to use the Unity Game engine to make 3D games in C#. This has been a fun and engaging project, and I feel it was well worth the amount of time it took to fully get immersed in. I have made a game which is similar to Uncharted as a kind of grand finale for the whole thing. It is far from perfect, but I am ready to move on to other things under the Comp E umbrella. After all, this project is about being broad and getting exposed rather than perfecting specific things. Please stay tuned, as next I will be helping my Uncle with a battery/electrical engineering problem. Soon after, I will begin work on a simple game engine. Below is the Unity project video, I hope you enjoy!
